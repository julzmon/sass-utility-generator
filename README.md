# SASS Utility Generator

This project generates utility CSS classes based on your design tokens and configuration, similar to Tailwind, but fully customizable and SASS-based.

**Documentation:**
- Use `//` single-line comments in all SCSS/SASS files for documentation and inline notes. These are ignored in the compiled CSS output.
- Avoid `/** ... */` JSDoc-style comments, as they may end up in the generated CSS.

## Configuration

- **CSS Variables:**
  - Edit `src/_variables.scss` to import or define your CSS variables.
- **Breakpoints:**
  - Edit `src/_breakpoints.scss` to configure responsive breakpoints (SASS map).
- **Prefix:**
  - Edit `src/_config.scss` to set the utility class prefix (e.g., `kds`).

## Utilities

- Margin, padding, gap, grid, flexbox, typography, background, foreground, border, font, icon, and animation utilities are generated by default.
- All output is wrapped in a CSS `@layer utilities`.
- Class names follow Tailwind-style naming, e.g., `kds-m-4`, `md:kds-m-4`.
- All responsive utilities are grouped under a single `@media` query per breakpoint for optimal output.

## Adding/Expanding Utilities

- Add or edit mixins in `src/mixins/` to expand or customize utility generation.
- Import new mixins and include them in `src/_utilities.scss` as needed.
- You can create your own utility types by following the pattern in the existing mixins.

## Building

Use Dart Sass to compile the output:

```
sass src/_utilities.scss dist/utilities.css --no-source-map
```
